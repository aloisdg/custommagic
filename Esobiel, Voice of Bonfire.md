I think that [[Tariel, Reckoner of Souls]] doesnt do a great job as a Mardu commander for Angel Tribal.
Since my SO wants to build her first angel tribal edh deck, here is one.

I would love the card to be tribal focus while not being another "+1/+1 anthem".

We can leverage the fact that most angel have Vigilance and a lot of them have lifelink and/or deathtouch.
Lets do something with those untapped bird. Lets do something divine, something magnificent.
Lets give them a reason to tap.

In Dominaria draft, I loved to ping with the [[Sorcerer's Wand]]. It is awesome with Vigilance and lifelink.
Alright our commander is going to give this kind of power to our angel flock.
For the wording, I am going to start with [[Mayor Avabruck]] and end with the wand. Pinging for 1 is enough for our case, but since we are red, lets ping any target and by targeting creature we leverage our angel having deathtouch.

Lets give her some keywords for good angel measure. We are not [[Akroma, Angel of Wrath]] nor [[Atraxa, Praetors'Voice]] but still.
 
Lets introduce Esobiel, Voice of Bonfire

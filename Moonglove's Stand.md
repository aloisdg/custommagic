# Moonglove's Stand

* Black has a lot of cheap combat trick with deathtouch. You can display them on Scryfall with [`c:black t:instant o:deathtouch cmc<=3 -t:creature`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=c%3Ablack+t%3Ainstant+o%3Adeathtouch+cmc%3C%3D3&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name)
* Black has a lot of cheap combat trick with indestructible. You can display them on Scryfall with [`c:black t:instant o:indestructible cmc<=3`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=c%3Ablack+t%3Ainstant+o%3Aindestructible+cmc%3C%3D3&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name)

Most of those card are not really good. I think we could mix both a create a powerful combat trick. If we use both, we need to put deathtouch before indestructible [`o:deathtouch o:indestructible`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3Adeathtouch+o%3Aindestructible&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name).

Since I would love to have a CMC of {B}, we need a downside to balance the card.

[Swords to Plowshares](https://scryfall.com/card/bbd/110/swords-to-plowshares) is one of the best instant removal of white. We can recycle its downside for our card. Of course, our card will not be that good because we will mostly use it during a combat to protect a creature a kill the other one.

Note that there is only one card with [`o:"lose life equal to its power"`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3A%22lose+life+equal+to+its+power%22&unique=cards&as=grid&order=name).

It might be more fair though to lose life equals to the CMC of the targeted creature instead of its power. After all we are talking about giving indestructible at instant speed for {B}.

I dont really like Phyrexian mana, but I could see this card being {1/P}{B}. Since Phyrexian mana is not an evergreen mechanic, I will pass though.

So everyone, is this card balance? If not, how can I fix it?
